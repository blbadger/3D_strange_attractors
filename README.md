# 3D_strange_attractors
Code to display plots of classic strange (fractal) attractors that exist in 3 dimensions, using Euler's method to model continuous-time ordinary differential equations.  Rossler attractor code is based on Vedran Sekara's write-up found here: https://vedransekara.github.io/2016/11/14/strange_attractors.html
